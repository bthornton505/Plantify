        <h1>Why Plantify?</h1>

        <p>
          Plantify is an application that allows users to not only create and save their
          most cherised vegan/vegetarian recipes, but a place for them to discover new and exciting recipes.

        <p>
          I had the inspiration for this app when a friend of mine explained a problem they had where whenver
          they would go to the grocery story, they couldn't come up with something to buy and make at home (specifically plant-based).
          They wanted a solution that would allow them to be in the grocery store, search quickly on their phone
          for a recipe that could incorporate an ingredient they had at home and get a list of ingredients so
          they could be purchased while they were shopping.
        </p>

        <p>
          An app was obviously the solution and I took it upon myself to make it the subject of my final project
          at the Flatiron School. Hopefully you enjoy this app as much as I do!
